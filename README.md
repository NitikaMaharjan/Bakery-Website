## Problem Statement

- **Inefficient Content Management**  
  Bakery owners often struggle to update bakery details like contact info, address, and branding.

- **Lack of Organized Product Catalog**  
  Tracking product names, prices, and descriptions manually is time-consuming and error-prone.

- **Difficulty in Managing Visual Content**  
  Without an easy system to upload and manage images, bakeries face limitations in showcasing their ambiance and offerings online.

---

## Objective

To develop a user-friendly bakery management system that allows admins to efficiently manage bakery information, product details, and images through a centralized dashboard.

---

## Scope

- **Centralized Content Management**  
  A single dashboard to manage all bakery data in one place.

- **User-Friendly Interface**  
  Designed for non-technical users to update content with ease.

- **Basic Functionality Implementation**  
  CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for bakery and product information.

---

## Limitations

- **Not Hosted Online**  
  Project is currently not deployed for public access.

- **No E-Commerce Integration**  
  The system is for display only. Online orders or payments are not supported.

- **Limited Scalability**  
  Built to manage a single bakery; not optimized for multi-branch use.
